# Note that the actual structure of this file (or its file format,
# for that matter), is only dependent on how you utilize it in your
# application. This particular one works with the provided vm-spawn.pl
# example, but nothing is stopping you from switching from YAML to JSON,
# using a completely different structure or dropping it altogether and
# using Bread::Board instead â€“ as long as your Perl code can make use
# of it. Hell, you can just go crazy and hardcode everything if that's
# what you like; this example config merely serves as an overview
# on what can (or: should) be configured
